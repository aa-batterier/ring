# ring with tcp network sockets and pthread

Sends a message through a ring of nodes.

The nodes are threads and the nodes are connected through tcp network sockets.

Is this the best way to do this? No, it's not!
Is this the most effektiv way to do this? No, it's not!
Is this the simplest way to do this? No, it's not!

But that's not the point of this projekt.
I think that createing a ring and send a message through that ring is a great exercise that can include a lot of differnet areas in a programming language.

The point of this ring is to train on tcp network sockets and threads.
